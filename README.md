## Description
-Lai Salon is a full featured salon website built with REACT, MongoDB, and Express. Lai Salon is our third and final project for UC Davis' Web Development Bootcamp, and we were excited to work with our first client to fulfill their professional image in an online space..

### Project Motivation:
- We were motivated to make a clean, professional career website to gain knowledge working with different technologies, and test our skills with styling and data manipulation. Our site was inspired by the work of our client Lai who's aesthetic and portfolio defined the styling of our website.

### Project Problem solved:
- Our project will be a onse size fits all salon website, able to be tailored to exact specifications of a clients needs. The site is scalable for one stylist or can be reengineered to support dozens of salon employees. Our site will handle booking, contacts, product sales, and salon location information including directions all from one easy to access webpage.

### Skills Learned during project:
- We have learned a ton about utilizing REACT to create truly incredible responsive user experiences, and how to integrate database api structures like graphql to make data queries to our mongoDB database simple and effective.

## Usage
- This project is very exciting in it's flexibility. Our application can be grown or shrunk to fit thousands of products or a few simple items, many different salon co-workers, or just one or two stylists. This application can also be changed to accomidate any clients in any skillset that can benefit from simple appointment booking and storefront services.
