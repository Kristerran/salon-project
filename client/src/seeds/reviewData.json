She kept me covid safe while keeping my hair upkept (including making me custom color take home kits when salons could not be open at all) until I left California. In fact when I moved across the country she made me a few take home kits to take with me so I could keep up her custom color a bit longer. Since I do non natural colors (usually) she'll dye it dark so that it can fade a while, so we talk about how the color will transition over time and if it'll look good rooted or not....she's just awesome.",
